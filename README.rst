Installation
------------


Checkout the simphony-framework repo::

  git clone https://github.com/simphony/simphony-framework.git
  cd simphony-framework

.. note::

  The SymPhoNy framework is developed and tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
  and the following commands and included scripts assume that they
  are executed inside the top level directory of the simphony-framework
  cloned repository.


Makefile
~~~~~~~~

To build and install the various parts of simphony framework a Makefile is provided.
Running ``make help`` list all the available targets.


Installing build dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All these targets make sure that the necessary libraries are installed by the
various apt repositories, and require ``sudo`` access::

  sudo make base
  sudo apt-openfoam
  sudo apt-simphony
  sudo apt-lammps
  sudo apt-mayavi


.. note::

   The ``apt-openfoam`` target will install openfoam version 2.2.2. To use this solver
   please activate the related environment::

     source /opt/openfoam222/etc/bashrc



Fix python setup tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to properly support installing the various python packages we need to use
the latest version of pip, setuptools and virtualenv. This target will make sure
that these packages are upgraded in you system::

  sudo make fix-pip


Setup virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is advised that the simphony framework is installed in a python
virtual environment to avoid contaminating the system python
with the simphony packages and allow a simpler user installation::

  make simphony-env

which will create a virtual enviroment in ``~/simphony`` or::


  SIMPHONYENV=<path> make simphony-env


.. note::

   From this point the simphony enviroment needs to be active::

     source ~/simphony/bin/activate


Install solvers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some solvers are not available as deb packages and need to be build locally.
To build them there are separate targets::

  make -j 2 lammps
  make -j 2 jyu-lb

Install Simphony
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  make simphony
  make simphony-plugins

.. note::

   individual simphony plugins can be installed using the related targets.


Complete script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  sudo make base apt-openfoam apt-simphony apt-lammps apt-mayavi fix-pip
  source /opt/openfoam222/etc/bashrc
  source ~/simphony/bin/activate
  make simphony-env
  make -j 2 lammps jyu-lb
  make simphony
  make simphony-plugins


Test
----

::

   make test-framework
